          <p className="mt-4">
            Alder and Rhodes specialises in limited-collection drops of seasonal garments. As such, our products are crafted with care and are released in small batches to maintain exclusivity and uniqueness. Due to the nature of our collections, products are subject to availability and may sell out quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Each product listing on our website includes detailed information such as sizing charts, care instructions, and material composition to help you make an informed purchase. We strongly encourage you to review this information carefully before making a purchase.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            While we strive to display colours and details of our products accurately, variations may occur due to differences in monitor settings or production processes. If you have specific concerns about a product, please contact us before placing your order.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            We reserve the right to modify or discontinue products without prior notice. Prices, descriptions, and availability of products are subject to change at our sole discretion.
